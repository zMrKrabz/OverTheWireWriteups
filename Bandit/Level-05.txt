The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

    human-readable
    1033 bytes in size
    not executable

To start things off, do `ls`, which will show that there's an `inhere` directory. `cd inhere` will bring you into the `inhere` directory. Now, `ls ` here will display

maybehere00  maybehere03  maybehere06  maybehere09  maybehere12  maybehere15  maybehere18
maybehere01  maybehere04  maybehere07  maybehere10  maybehere13  maybehere16  maybehere19
maybehere02  maybehere05  maybehere08  maybehere11  maybehere14  maybehere17

which are all directories. In order to find the file in these directory that satisfys all the above requirements, do 

find -type f -readable -size 1033c ! -executable

`find` will locate the file starting from the directory that it is executed in.
`-type f` lets the command know that you want to find a file
`-readable` shows that you want to find a file that's readable
`-size 1033c` shows that you want a file that is 1033 bits

Everything after ! shows the things you don't want to match, so `! -executable` means you want a file that's not executable.

The command will return `./maybehere07/.file2`. Doing `cat ./maybehere07/.file2` Will give you the flag `DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7`
