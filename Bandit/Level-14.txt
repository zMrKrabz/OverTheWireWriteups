Now that you can read `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14`, go ahead and grab that password `4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e`. Use `nc localhost 30000` to connect to the service running on port 30000. After connecting, paste in the password. The flag that should return is `BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr`
