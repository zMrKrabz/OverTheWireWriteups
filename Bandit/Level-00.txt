To log onto the first level, do
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
The password should be bandit0

This is where you would get the flag to access level 1

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

When you first log onto the server, you will be put into the home directory. If you do `ls`, you would see there is a file called `readme`.
Use `cat readme` to print out the contents of that file 
The flag should be: `boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1`
