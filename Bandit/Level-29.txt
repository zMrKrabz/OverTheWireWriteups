There is a git repository at ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo. The password for the user bandit29-git is the same as for the user bandit29.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

Do what we did on bandit27. repo/README shows:

# Bandit Notes
Some notes for bandit30 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit30
- password: <no passwords in production!>

Nothing shows in `git log`. However, if we use the `-p` flag, it will show the diff between each commit. Since there must be no password in production, let's see what other branches exists. Do:

`git branch -r`

There is a `/dev` branch. Lets see what's on that:

git checkout dev

Now README reads:

# Bandit Notes

## credentials

- username: bandit30
