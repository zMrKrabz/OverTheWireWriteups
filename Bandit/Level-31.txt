There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

This is what `README` says:

This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master

Let's make that file, with `vim`. After you've created the file following those details, do:

git add key.txt
git commit -m key.txt
git push origin master

Here's what you just did:
- Added `key.txt` to your commit
- Commited to master
- Pushed to master

If you get something about `.gitignore`, use the -f flag.

The password is 56a9bf19c63d650ce78e6ec0354ee45e
