The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

Once again, in order to connect to the server, you need to do `ssh -p 2220 bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org` with the password being the flag from the last level, `CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9`.

To start the level, do `ls` to check which files are in this directory. It will print out
`spaces in this filename`

To read a file with spaces in it's name, you need to wrap the filename in quotes, or escape the space character using `\`. There are 2 ways to get this flag

cat "spaces in this filename"

or

cat ./spaces\ in\ this\ filename

Both will give you the flag: `UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK`
