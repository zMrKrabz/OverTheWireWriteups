The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

If you try to log in, it'll say "Byebye!" and log you out. Clowns. If you read the manpage for `ssh`, you can see that you have the option of firing a command once you log in. SO:

`ssh bandit18@localhost ls`

returns `readme`. Now, repeat that command but instead of `ls` do `cat readme`. The password is `IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x`
