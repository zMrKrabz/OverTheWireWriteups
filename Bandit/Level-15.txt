The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

To connect to a service and encrypt it with SSL (like our browser connecting to websites`, you need to use `openssl`. COnnect with the following connamd:

`openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001`

`s_client` specifies we are connecting as a client
`-connect` flag specifies that we are connecting to a service
`localhost:30001` specifies we are connecting to the address localhost on the port 30001

Paste the flag and you'll get `cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd`
