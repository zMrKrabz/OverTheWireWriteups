Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

This one was a breather from all the chaos that was bandit 15-25. if you do ls, you find `bandit27.do`. If you examine it with `file bandit27.do`, you find that it is a setuid binary, basically invoking commands as another user. Let's do:

`./bandit27.do whoami`

THat outputs:

`bandit27`

Good. To get bandit27's flag, you must read `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`. We need to execute the `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27` with ./bandit27-do. Let's try:

./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27

The password is 3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea
