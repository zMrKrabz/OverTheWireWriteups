There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo. The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

Do what we did the last level. In repo/README, it reads:

# Bandit Notes
Some notes for level29 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit29
- password: xxxxxxxxxx

Hmmm, the password is censored. Since this is a challenge involving git, let's peep `git log` and see what happened.Commit `073c27c130e6ee407e12faad1dd3848a110c4f95` stands out. We need to revert the git commit to the previous one. Check out `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-do-i-revert-a-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit` on how to do that. In short, do:

git checkout 073c27c130e6ee407e12faad1dd3848a110c4f95

Now repo/README reads:

# Bandit Notes
Some notes for level29 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit29
- password: bbc96594b4e001778eee9975372716b2
