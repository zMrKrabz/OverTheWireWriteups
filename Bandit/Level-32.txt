After all this git stuff its time for another escape. Good luck!

Logging into the server displays:

WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
We can't execute any commands in uppercase. How can we espcape this shell? Well, if we do `$0`, it allows us to execute the shell again. Since $0 isn't a letter, it wouldn't be affected by uppercase shell.

Now, execute whoami, showing you are bandit33. Get the password of bandit33 by doing `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33`.

The password is: c9c3199ddf4121b10cf581a98d51caee
