The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.

In data.txt, it displays 
`VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIElGdWt3S0dzRlc4TU9xM0lSRnFyeEUxaHhUTkViVVBSCg==`

To decode this, you need to use the `base64` command. Normally, that command will encode the file. In order to decode it, you need the `-d` flag. The command to get the flag is `base64 -d data.txt`. The flag is `IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR`
