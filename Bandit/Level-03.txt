The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

After connecting to the server, `ls` shows us a directory called `inhere`. You can use `cd` to go into that directory. Now, if you normally do `ls`, you would see that the directory is "empty". However, do display hidden files, you need to add the `-a` flag to `ls`.

This will display when we do `ls -a`
.  ..  .hidden

Do `cat .hidden` to get the flag `pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB`
