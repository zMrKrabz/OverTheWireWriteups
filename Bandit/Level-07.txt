The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

After connecting to the server, you see a file called `data.txt`. If we do `more data.txt`, it is a bunch of lines with a word and a key. To find the key next to the word `millionth`, do:

`grep millionth data.txt`

This will return:
millionth	cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

The password to the next level is `cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV`
